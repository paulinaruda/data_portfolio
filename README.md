# Data analyst portfolio

Hello visitor!<br>
It is my pleasure to welcome you here in my professional data portfolio, please enjoy your stay ;) <br> 
This portfolio consists of a showcase of my skills in Python and SQL, but please be aware that these are not the only data related skills I have. <br>

## My professional experience <br>
I joined Data Science in Tesco, London, England in September 2020 as an apprentice and learned data analytics and some data science concepts on the job, which really helped me get a real life experience and get my hands dirty in he vast amounts of data that such a big organisation has. <br>
I graduated from the apprenticeship in March 2022 as on of the three aprentices with distinction on a 50 persons course and since then working in Analytics Capabilities. <br>
