# Data analyst portfolio

Hello visitor!<br> <br>
It is my pleasure to welcome you here in my professional data portfolio, please enjoy your stay ;) <br> 
This portfolio consists of a showcase of my skills in Python and SQL, but please be aware that these are not the only data related skills I have. <br>

## My professional experience <br>
I joined Data Science in Tesco, London, England in September 2020 as an apprentice and learned data analytics and some data science concepts on the job. This really helped me get a real life experience and get my hands dirty in he vast amounts of data that such a big organisation has. <br>
I graduated from the apprenticeship in March 2022 as on of the three aprentices with distinction on a 50 persons course and since continuing to work for Tesco in Analytics Capabilities Department. <br>
<br>
My area of professional interest is in data analysis and data science in food and health industries and it is broadly covered with my background in medicine in a functional approach (I graduated from masters of physioterapy, and nutrition and healthy lifestyle is my big interest for at least 5 years now) and farming (I am currently doing a postgraduate degree in this field). I believe that the biological systems that we live in are self-sustaining and all they need is a little help to be self-restored. I would really like to be able to use that knowledge more widely to promote more healthy approach to life in general public. <br> 
### Projects that I was part of and my role in them<br>
#### Computer vision platform
While on my apprenticeship in data science team I was an analyst of the performance of visual recognition of products in a non-production environment. I checked such values as precision and recall and based on available data estimated which entries may confuse the model (Python + SQL). <br>
#### Jenkins - channels project SQL querying automation 
I introduced and productionalised Jenkins tool usage for everyday automation of SQL queries that were failing in Hadoop environment. This helped the company save hours of manual querying and reduced the time to query and made it possible for a dashboard automation (Python + SQL). 
#### Health project
##### Products labelling with a tree structure
I labeled 15 milions of products own brand based on their ingredients using an automated tree structure, that made it possible to see which products certain types of ingredients and made it possible to assign them labels based on these ingredients. I managed to save hundreds of hours of manual labeling to the company and suggested changes to make this approach futureproof (Python + SQL).
##### Loyal customers assesment
I produced a KNN algorythm that assigned customers to different levels of brand loyalty based on their shopping data. This provided the opportunity for more personalised add tailoring. 
#### Floorplanning project
I was analyzing the floorplans generated by automated tools and the compliance of introducing them in the stores that these were proposed to (Python).

## The projects on my portfolio
The projects that you can see in my portfolio are a representation of my previous experience and interest, but due to the confidentiality closure are not the exact ones that I was a part of. <br>
Please enjoy your stay :)
